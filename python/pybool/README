pybool: A python package that infers Boolean networks given a set of constraints.

Consider the common scenario of a biologist who is studying a particular
regulatory network. They study a set of genes that are known to play a role in the
network. They have some background knowledge of particular regulatory connections
from his own studies or from the literature. In addition to this they have
perturbation data that reveals the temporal order of expression of the genes under
some conditions. For example, these could be derived from loss-of-function
or over-expression experiments. The biologist would like to elucidate the entire
network and to this end can perform various experiments to test particular regulatory
connections. These experiments are costly and time-consuming. Which
connections should they focus on? This is where the pybool package can help.
By modelling candidate regulatory networks using Boolean logic, pybool evaluates
which networks are consistent with the perturbation data and the known
regulatory connections.
